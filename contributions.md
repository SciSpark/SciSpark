Infrastructure Contributions
====

In addition to providing SciSpark to users from all over the world for free, our work has also led us to contributing back to the open source software that we rely on. This includes efforts that have improved the existing infrastructure for Apache Cassandra, ND4J, Apache Spark and Apache Zeppelin. People from our team who have contributed back to these projects include Rahul Palamuttam, Chris A. Mattmann, Sujen Shah and Renato Marroquin Mogrovejo. The entire team that makes SciSpark itself possible can be found [here](https://scispark.jpl.nasa.gov/theteam.html).

Our infrastructure stack is as follows.

Here is a map of where people come from who are interested in SciSpark. If the dot representing them is blue, they are watching SciSpark and/or have starred it, and if their dot is red, they have only starred it. This is missing about 10 people, because their locations were not specified on GitHub.
